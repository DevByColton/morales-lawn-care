  My name is Colton Morales. I am a Software Developer for my 9 to 5, and this lawn mowing buiness
  is my side job, which I thoroughly enjoy! I enjoy the outdoors in general,
  I love to fish, mostly salt water when I can get down to Corpus, but I enjoy fresh water fishing too.
  This is a picture of me and my better half! I want my service to feel less like a buiness and more
  like a friend coming to mow your lawn.
